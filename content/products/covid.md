HPRC members who are able to remain focused on this research will continue to engage in the following activities.

## Policy and Administration
* Development of HPRC protocols and policy will continue as needs are identified.
* In the coming days, a policy for data use and publications will be released.

## Sample Selection and Diversity
* Researchers will continue to engage and discuss diversity in the context of sample selection in order to meet the aims of this project. 
T* his group will also continue to communicate with other international efforts focused on the human reference. 
* Groups interested in contacting the HPRC can reach us through our website.

## Data Production
* Data generation will be significantly reduced due to the closure of many of the laboratories engaged in Human Pangenome Reference work.  An adjusted data production timeline can be found [here](http://humanpangenome.org/data/).
* Laboratories that will continue to produce data will use social distancing and enhanced laboratory cleaning protocols to ensure the safety of their teams.
* The Technology and Production Working group continues to receive regular updates from each laboratory. 

## Assembly and Analysis
* Teams are currently engaged in the quality assessment of assemblies utilizing the HG002 test data found [here](http://humanpangenome.org/hg002/).

## Outreach and Engagement
* While the pandemic has made travel impossible right now, those dedicated to this mission will continue to the develop materials needed to engage the scientific community.

In the coming weeks and months, the scientific community will continue to be focused on finding ways to save lives during the pandemic. HPRC leadership will continue to follow this research closely in case there are opportunities for engagement.
