The Human Pangenome Project aims to improve the human reference genome to represent a collection of common haplotypes in human populations, with a pangenome reference assembly that reflects genomic diversity across the globe. As such HPRC has commited to the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) mission and principles and supports its [Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data](https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/regulatory-ethics-toolkit/framework-for-responsible-sharing-of-genomic-and-health-related-data/) and aims to adopt GA4GH deliverables where appropriate. Learn more in the [GA4GH startup guide](https://www.ga4gh.org/about-us/startup-guide/) and get started as an active contributor in the GA4GH community.
